## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `app.js` and start building out the app's functionality
For modifying the code open `index.html` and for editing your own style open `styles.css`
For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Rubrics
Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity code reviewer according to the Landing Page `project rubric`. Please make sure to re-review the rubric for detailed project requirements prior to submission.
